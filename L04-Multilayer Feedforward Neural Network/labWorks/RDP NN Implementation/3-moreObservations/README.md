    - In this file, I dmeonstrate RDP implementation with single layer persceptron more clearly based on my observations
    - here dataset is (non linearly- seperable)NLS. so it is understandble
    - by 11th epoch itself, the NN met the convergence (you can see the division between two classes in the 2D plot as well as 3D plot
=> nnMoreDetailed_1.m
    - in which, I used another non-linear-seperable dataset(NLS) to check the RDP NN.
    - here we use 8 solution dataset.
    - observation: even after 1000 epoches, the plane couldn't divide the classes (see 3D plot)
